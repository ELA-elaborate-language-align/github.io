				<h2>Great School Experience Start Here</h2>

				<p>Starting school is an important milestone for every child and their parents. 
					At CleverLand we believe that when children leave our nurseries to embark on 
					the next chapter in their lives we must do all we can to support and 
					celebrate this transition, ensuring the children are well prepared for 
					the next stage in their learning. Within all CleverLand nurseries it is 
					a firm belief that all children need to be able to start school ready to 
					learn, that they are able to make friends and play and that they are 
					confident to ask for what they need and voice what they think.</p>

				
				<p>Children’s early experiences are paramount for their future 
					success and these are influenced by many factors including 
					the impact of their early education and care. Parents and 
					Key Persons working together in partnership are important 
					to develop the home learning environment. By working together 
					we believe that this will help improve your child’s progress 
					and support them in making a better start at school. </p>
				<br>
				<p>The learning enhancements at CleverLand complement&nbsp;
				the&nbsp;already quality and stimulating environment for
				your&nbsp;child.&nbsp;Each enhancement&nbsp;offers different 
				play and learning opportunities within day-to-day activities 
				and practice. Making a positive impact to young children's 
				learning and development is adding value to their young lives 
				in preparation for their future.</p>		

				<p>Our enhancements&nbsp;help to ensure we maintain our 
				status as the market leader of providing quality 
				childcare across the country. Opportunities and 
				experiences presented from these projects ensures 
				we maintain our status as the market leader and 
				separates us from other childcare providers.</p>

				<p>At CleverLand Academy we believe that it is important to liaise with 
					the school prior to children joining them and keep an open communication with 
					the teachers from the public school our kids attend in the daily basis. </p>

				<p>Skilful early years educators, provide a special place where children are 
					the centre of everything, filling their hearts and minds with a sense of 
					awe and wonder on their individual learning journey, while giving them 
					the confidence to develop their own theories about the world.</p>
