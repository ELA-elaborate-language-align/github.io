			<h2>Purpose of the Early Years Foundation Stage</h2>
			
<p>Play opportunities are non-stereotypical and available to all 
	children promoting the teaching and learning from a skilled workforce. </p>
	<h2>Prime</h2>
	<ul>

<li>Communication and Language</li>
<li>Physical Development</li>
<li>Personal, Social and Emotional Development</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Specific</h2>
	<ul>
<li>Literacy</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Understanding the World</li>
<li>Expressive Arts and Design</li>

	</ul>
<p>Research into early child development shows 
	that children learn more rapidly during their 
	first three years than in later life; whilst all 
	areas of learning are important and inter-connected, 
	the three Prime areas that are crucial for igniting 
	children's curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, building 
	their capacity to learn and form relationships and thrive. 
	The specific areas will enable them to be self-motivated learners 
	who are confident to succeed.</p>
			<article>
				<h2>Communication and Language</h2>
					<p>Involves children being provided with the opportunity 
						to experience a language rich environment; develop confidence 
						in expressing their wants, needs and feelings and being able 
						to speak and listen in a variety of contexts.</p>
			
			<h2>Physical Development</h2>
			<p>Involves children being encouraged to be interactive and active in their 
				learning and develop control, coordination and movement. They are supported 
				in understanding the importance of physical activity and how to make informed 
				healthy choices at meal times.</p>
			
			<h2>Personal, Social and Emotional Development</h2>
			<p>Involves supporting children in developing a strong, positive sense of themselves, 
				and of others; form strong attachments and relationships and develop respect for 
				others to develop their social skills and learn how to effectively manage their feelings.
				This area also supports the children in understanding appropriate behaviour and develops 
				confidence in their own abilities.</p>
			</article>
			<h2>Literacy</h2>
			<p>Encourages children to link sounds and letters and begin to read and write. Children are given 
				access to a wide range of reading materials to ignite their interest.</p>
<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>Encourages opportunities to develop and improve counting skills, understanding and using numbers, 
	calculating simple addition and subtraction problems and to describe shapes, space and measures.</p>

<h2>Understanding the World</h2>
<p>Involves supporting children in making sense of the world around them and their community by providing 
	opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places, technology and the environment.</p>

<h2>Expressive Arts and Design</h2>
<p>Enables children to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials, as well as encouraging the 
sharing of thoughts, ideas and feelings through a variety of activities in art, music, movement, dance, 
role-play and design and technology.</p>


<p>When planning and guiding activities practitioners will reflect upon the different ways that children 
	learn and ensure they utilise this within their practice. The Characteristics of Effective Learning are:</p> 
	
	<h2>Playing and Exploring</h2>
	<p>Supports children's engagement and investigation and to experience things through being willing to 'have a go'</p>
	
	<h2>Active Learning</h2>

	<p>Supports children's motivation to learn by helping develop their concentration, ability and will to keep trying 
		when challenges occur and celebration of completing a task.</p>
	
	<h2>Creating and Thinking Critically</h2>

	<p>Supports children's thinking skills through developing ideas, making links between differing ideas and create 
		strategies for completing a task.</p>
