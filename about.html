				<h2>Holding ourselves to a higher standard</h2>

				<p>Everything we do—from curriculum to assessments—is designed to make our 
				classrooms places where children can truly thrive.</p>
<ul>
	<h2><li>Parents rely on our teaching skills</li></h2>
	<p>We hire teachers who thrive in investing in CleverLand Future.</p>
	<h2><li><strong>21st century approach to education</strong></li></h2>
<p>Our education team leads the industry. They use the most up-to-date research to build our 
	curriculum, a curriculum that empowers teachers to help kids follow their dreams—today and for years to come.</p>    


			<h2><li>Our Mission</li></h2>
			<br>
		<p>We started CleverLand because we wanted to provide exciting, 
			innovative care for our children, in an environment that 
			presented plentiful opportunities for play, interaction and 
			development, at their own pace and in their own space, simply 
			because we wanted them to have the best possible start in life.</p>
			</br>
			

			<p>We created a nursery environment that is safe, and learning 
				opportunities are always plentiful. We recruited staff 
				with passion, enthusiasm and a never-ending commitment to 
				the children. Parents were always reassured that their 
				child(ren)' happiness, because their emotional needs are met, 
				their interests are nurtured and their individuality 
				is respected.</p>

<h2>Our Personel</h2>		
				<p>We continue to keep this type of excellence in all of our activities 
					and there really is something about a CleverLander child that 
					sets them apart. <img src="images/26.jpg" width="45%">They are happy, sociable, confident, independent, 
					creative and unique.  They love to explore and try new things and 
					are guided each and every day in all kinds of little ways.</p>
					
				<p>Skilful early years educators, provide a special place where children are 
					the centre of everything, filling their hearts and minds with a sense of 
					awe and wonder on their individual learning journey, while giving them 
					the confidence to develop their own theories about the world.</p>
