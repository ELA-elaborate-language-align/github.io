					<p>Developing a secure bond with their key person allows them to explore and play freely but feel safe within the environment. They will have activities and quality learning 
					experiences planned for them based on their individual needs.</p> 
					<h2>For the parents</h2>
					The key person approach provides them with a dedicated staff member who fully understands the learning, development and care needs of their child, this gives you the 
					confidence to leave your child at the nursery knowing they will be cared for in a way that is tailored to the information that you provide.  
					<br><br>
					Sharing of information allows the key person to maintain a continuity of care and ensure collaborate partnership working between home and the nursery setting. 
					<h2>Settling in</h2>
					At CleverLand your key person will meet with you during your 'settling in visits', during this time they will discuss your child's individual routines, the people who are
				
					special to them, their likes and dislikes and any other key information to ensure this is incorporated into the daily care of your child. Each key person has a sound 
					knowledge and range of skills to enable them in providing parents with advice and guidance and supporting any concerns with starting nursery or completing transitions 
					from room to room and on to school.
					<h2>Your key person</h2>
					Your key person will generally be the person who welcomes you and your child into the nursery and supports them in settling into the session. They will also be the main 
					practitioner carrying out the child's intimate care needs, such as putting to sleep, diapers, spare changing clothes and physical closeness. Any information shared with the parents is 
					also done mainly through the key person.
					<br><br>
					To ensure consistent continuity of care for all children, each key person is paired with a 'buddy' who will take on the role of the key person during periods of absence 
					such as holidays. It is part of the key person's role to ensure that their 'buddy' and other staff within the environment are aware of their key children's needs and 
					have a strong relationship with the parents to enable clear communication.
